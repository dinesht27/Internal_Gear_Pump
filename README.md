<h1>3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing - Internal Gear Pump </h1>
<p>  
This project involves development of a demonstration model of a gear based machine element (the Internal Gear pump) used for an animated education video and fabricable with additive manufacturing designed parametrically with IceSl as Lua script.

This projects aims at understanding the principle behind the 3D printing technologies and Additive Manufacturing, how the scripted models are devloped, how slicing of the models are interpreted, and by end of the project the parametrical model is readily available for to be 3D printed.

<h2>IceSl as Lua script (Scripting Language)</h2>
<p>
IceSl: Advanced modeling and slicing for 3D printing with Lua script interface. (https://icesl.loria.fr)
Lua: lightweight, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language designed primarily for embedded use in applications. Lua is cross-platform (…) and Lua has a relatively simple C API to embed it into applications. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language))

<h2> Modeule Package and Task </h2>
This is a Team project realised between two students from the Technische Hochschule Deggendorf. This project is realised with workload encompassing development of a parametrical model, Sceintific Paper with required technical background, and a short video demostrating the working principle of the topic (Internal Gear Pump). 
This study package include the following files based on the task performed as stated below:
<ul>
<li> A Web article: The advantages and disadvantages of gearing mechanism made by additive manufacturing and how to deal with them. </li>
<li> Compilation of the facts of the topic as a technical report. </li>
<li> Implementation of a parametrically module that creates the main machine element(s) of the topic as Lua script in IceSl as STL file with a supporting instruction manual. </li>
<li> Creation of a short instructional tutorial for the Lua script for IceSl. </li>
<li> Video clip as educational film with the help of the animated display model based on STL files created with the Lua script in IceSl. </li>
